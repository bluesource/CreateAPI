# CreateAPI 0.x

## 0.1.0

### August 16, 2022

### Enhancements

- [#69](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/69) - Publish release to Homebrew.
- [#48](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/48) - Support Swift Package Plugins.
- [#58](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/58) - Improve readme, add usage documentation and contributing guides.
- [#47](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/47) - Override any option in the configuration file from the command line using `--config-option`.
- [#85](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/85) - Add custom package dependencies in generated package.
- [#114](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/114) - Allow custom mapping between schema data types/formats and Swift types used in generation.
- [#125](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/pull/125) - Raise an error if the `--config` file doesn't exist instead of silently falling back to the default options.
- [#90](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/pull/90) - Produce warnings when configuration files contain unknown or deprecated options.
- [#76](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/pull/76) - Add `--version` option/command.
- [#71](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/71) - Support excluding individual properties on entities.
- [#116](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/pull/116), [#141](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/pull/141) - Write extension source files into **Extensions** directory and improve their filenames.
- [#131](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/pull/131) - Raise an error if you use `--clean` when the `--output` directory also contains the schema or config file.
- [#138](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/pull/138) - Trim whitespace from the `fileHeaderComment`.
- [#140](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/pull/140) - Run path generation in parallel.

### Breaking Changes

- [#83](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/pull/83) - Generated packages and paths now depend on Get 1.0.2 or later. If you don't use Get, your `Request` type must expose an initializer that matches the [initializer defined in Get](https://github.com/kean/Get/blob/db5248ce985c703c5ea0030b7c4d3f908db304c9/Sources/Get/Request.swift#L27-L41).
- [#88](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/88) - When generating a Swift Package, the **Package.swift** file and all other sources are written to the root of the `--output` directory instead of being nested inside a subdirectory.
- [#132](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/pull/132) Default output directory is now **./CreateAPI** when `--output` is not specified.
- [#112](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/112) - The `rename.properties` option now understands property names as defined in the original schema and not after applying CreateAPI transformations (such as case conversion or swifty style booleans).
- [#125](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/pull/125) - The generator will now error if the path defined using `--config` did not contain a valid file (prior behaviour was to fallback to the default configuration).
- [#47](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/47) - Command Line Argument options that alter the generate output have now been moved into the configuration file and the behaviour may have also been adjusted.
  - `--split` (`-s`) is now the default behavior. Use the `mergeSources` option to merge generated source files.
  - `--filename-template` has been replaced by the `entities.filenameTemplate` and `paths.filenameTemplate` options.
  - `--entityname-template` has been replaced by the `entities.nameTemplate` option.
  - `--generate` has been replaced by the `generate` option and now accepts `paths`, `entities`, `enums` and `package` to customize which components are generated.
  - `--package` and `--module` have been incorporated as part of the `generate` option (see above) for controlling the generated outputs and the module/package name is configured using the `module` option.
  - `--vendor` has been replaced by the `vendor` option.
- [#100](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/100) - For `entities`, `isGeneratingStructs` and `isMakingClassesFinal` have merged into a single `defaultType` option (accepted values `struct`, `class` or `finalClass`).
  - `isGeneratingMutableClassProperties` and `isGeneratingMutableStructProperties` have been replaced by a single `mutableProperties` option. Specify `true`, `false`, `structs` or `classes` instead.
  - `entitiesGeneratedAsClasses` and `entitiesGeneratedAsStructs` have been replaced by a single `typeOverrides` option.
- [#98](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/98) - `comments` options have been replaced with a single `commentOptions` property that accepts `false`, `true` or an array containing any of `[title, description, example, externalDocumentation, capitalized]`.
- [#97](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/97) - `isReplacingCommonAcronyms`, `addedAcronyms` and `ignoredAcronyms` have been replaced with a single `acronyms` option.
- [#94](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/94) - `isSwiftLintDisabled` has been removed. Use `fileHeaderComment` if you want to replicate this behavior.
- [#93](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/93) - `isAdditionalPropertiesOnByDefault` has been removed with no replacement.
- [#92](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/92) - Every generated `Request` now includes its `operationId` and the `isAddingOperationIds` option has now been removed.
- [#91](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/pull/91) - Fixed a spelling mistake in `overridenResponses` and `overridenBodyTypes`.
- [#63](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/63) - `isInliningPropertiesFromReferencedSchemas` behavior is now enabled by default and the option has renamed to `inlineReferencedSchemas`.
- [#75](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/75) - `isGeneratingCustomCodingKeys` behavior is now enabled by default and the option has been renamed to `optimizeCodingKeys`.
- [#66](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/66) - `access` no longer accepts an open string. The value must be either `internal` or `public`.
- [#114](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/114), [#145](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/pull/145) - `isUsingIntegersWithPredefinedCapacity` has been removed. You can now configure data type mappings to Swift types using the `dataTypes` option.
- [#134](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/pull/134) - `isGeneratingEnums` has been removed and is now configurable as part of the new `generate` option.
- [#89](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI/issues/89) - Swifty style boolean properties in the configuration file have been renamed.
